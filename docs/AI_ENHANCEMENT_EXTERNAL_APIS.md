## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### **API Integration Architecture**
```typescript
// Example service structure for external APIs
interface ExternalAPIService {
  fetchMarketData(symbol: string): Promise<MarketData>;
  getNewsAnalysis(company: string): Promise<NewsAnalysis>;
  processDocument(file: File): Promise<DocumentAnalysis>;
}

// Unified external data enrichment
const enrichAnalysisWithExternalData = async (
  listing: Listing,
  analysis: EnhancedBusinessAnalysis
): Promise<EnhancedBusinessAnalysis> => {
  const [marketData, newsData, competitiveData] = await Promise.all([
    fetchMarketIntelligence(listing.industry),
    fetchNewsAnalysis(listing.title),
    fetchCompetitiveData(listing.website)
  ]);

  return {
    ...analysis,
    realTimeMarketContext: marketData,
    newsImpactAnalysis: newsData,
    competitiveIntelligence: competitiveData
  };
};
```

### **Caching Strategy**
- **Market Data**: 1-hour cache for real-time data
- **News Data**: 30-minute cache for breaking news
- **Company Data**: 24-hour cache for static information
- **Economic Data**: Weekly cache for macro indicators

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Analysis continues if external APIs fail
- **Confidence Scoring**: Lower confidence when external data unavailable
- **User Notification**: Clear indication when enhanced features are limited
